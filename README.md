- **Set specific learning goals**: Clearly define what you want to learn and why. This will help you stay motivated and focused.

- **Practice actively**: Don't just read or listen to lectures - try to actively engage with the material. This could include writing notes, asking questions, or teaching the material to someone else.

- **Take breaks**: It's important to take breaks and give your brain time to process the information you have learned.
